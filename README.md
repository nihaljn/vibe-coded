# Vibe Coded

A repository of projects created mostly with the help of whatever AI tool I'm using at the time.

**07-30-2025**: mostly Claude Code

#### Project Structure

```
vibe-coded/
├── .env                     # Environment configuration (REQUIRED)
├── data/                    # Centralized data storage
│   ├── project-1/           # data for project-1
│   └── ...
├── project-1/               # project-1 
└── ...
```

#### Environment Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: The `.env` file at the root contains the absolute path to your vibe-coded directory. This must be updated manually when you move the project or work on different machines.
